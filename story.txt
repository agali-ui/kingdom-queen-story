Once upon a time, in a land called Aurelia, there lived a valiant queen who 
ruled her kingdom with an iron fist. Her citizens were happy under her rule:
when there was illness, she commanded the doctors and nurses to act swiftly 
and accordingly. When struck with the threat of an oncoming winter storm, she
ordered an immediate evacuation and ensured that all her beloved people were 
safe. When threatened by war, she herself rushed to the front lines to defend
her people. Even though she could be harsh sometimes, her people knew of her
kindness and endless devotion; they thought she was magnificent in the way 
that she powered through almost every single problem that came her way. 

However, one day, the people of the kingdom discovered a horrible secret.
She was actually a bastard of the former king, King Jarya. The people of
Aurelia could not accept a queen that was not the rightful heir to the 
throne. It was a mythical curse that only the true blood of the former Kings
could be ruling the country. But, but there is one way that you can break the
curse, but a horrible one...
